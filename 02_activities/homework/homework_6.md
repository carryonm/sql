My Reflection on Data Ethics

Previously, I worked for companies operating social media and entertainment products with a large user base. Issues related to data ethics are prevalent in the day-to-day operations of such companies.

Starting with user privacy, user data is immensely valuable for these companies as it is closely tied to user growth and commercialization. However, there are significant concerns regarding how social products collect, use, and share the data, both internally and externally. One potential improvement to user privacy practices would be to not only increase transparency about what data is being collected, but also to offer users easier control over their own data. In reality, some products even employ misleading designs to trick users into providing more personal information, while making the opt-out processes very difficult. Given the fierce competition in the social media space, I believe would be more promising for initiatives and standards to be developed through industry-wide coalitions or regulatory bodies, alongside public education to raise awareness

Bias in database design is also a major issue for social products which serve highly diverse user base. Small oversights in design can lead to the exclusion of minority groups. For instance, if a product requires identity verification but only supports restrictive and limited forms, those who cannot provide the required documentation are excluded. Furthermore, design details in data entry and how users are categorized and presented can directly influence social dynamics on a social platform, often in subtle ways that only become noticeable over time. Professionals working in the fields should conduct thorough research and prepare diligently before making decisions that may be hard to reverse later. Also, creating an industry-wide community that shares general guidelines and training materials would be highly beneficial.
