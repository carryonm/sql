# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).


Answer: below is the logical model for the bookstore:

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

Answer: below is the logical model for the bookstore, with a employee shift table,in which the "shift_type" column specifies whether a shift is a morning shift or an evening shift.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...
```

Answer: 
The table which overwrites will be a Type 1 (see the 1st pic below) and the table which retain historical changes will be Type2  (see the 2nd pic below).

Regarding privacy implications: Yes, there are privacy concerns. An individual's address information is sensitive data and many people may not want retailers to retain their past address information for extended periods. There is risk of unauthorized access or misuse of personal information.  

Type1- only the latest address is kept

Type2- historical addresses are kept

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer...
```

2 interesting differences:
First: The AdventureWorks categorizes all tables into 4 categories, according to the business process and functions: sales, production, purchase, person (regarding external persons in both purchase and sales), HumanResources (internal people and activities), dbo(on database management).
Second: The AdventureWorks collects and stores much richer and detailed information of the product, such as product description (in tables named ProductPhoto, ProductModel, ProductDescription, ProductCategory, ProductSubcategory, etc.).

Would you change anything in yours?
Yes, Iâ€™d like to group the tables in my ERD into 4 main categories: sales, purchase, book (product description and inventory) and employee management.This'd make the whole ERD clearer and easier to use.
Additionally, if with more understanding of the operation of the bookstore, I can add more tables and refine the columns and data categories in them (that is what data is valuable for collection and management).
